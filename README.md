# To understand the system, you can watch demo video or read ProjectReport that i uploaded.
# Used technologies and how it works
- XAMPP: For creating MySQL server
- Python: With flask library i was able to manage my database that holds rooms data and use them on HTML pages. 
- MetaMask: Provides us to manage our crypto wallets on google chrome as plugin.
- Truffle Ganache: Provides us to create a virtual ethereum net instead of using main ethereum network. It also provides 10 ethereum wallet with 100 eth that i used them with MetaMask provider.
- Web3js: It a Javascript library for using metamask on your HTML page and it made me able to reach deployed contract and its functions inside it. It is the core technology for developing this system.
